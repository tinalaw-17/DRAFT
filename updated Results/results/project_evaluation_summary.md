# Cloud Platform Comparison for Machine Learning Workloads
## Experimental Results and Preliminary Analysis

**Document Classification:** Research Report - Preliminary Findings  
**Execution Date:** August 31, 2025  
**Analysis Period:** 14:30:00 - 16:45:00 UTC (2 hours 15 minutes)  
**Status:** EXPERIMENT COMPLETED

---

## Executive Summary

This experimental study compared Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for machine learning workloads using three datasets across different scales. Results suggest potential GCP advantages in cost efficiency (24.0% reduction) and performance (10.7% faster average execution), though findings are based on limited testing (2h 15m execution, 3 datasets) and require extensive validation.

**Key Results:** 12 experiments completed with 100% success rate. Mixed statistical significance (3 of 4 hypotheses supported at p < 0.05). Preliminary cost extrapolation suggests ~$7,000-9,000 annual cost difference potential, though highly speculative.
