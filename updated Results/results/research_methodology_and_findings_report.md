- **Scalability:** GCP demonstrates superior performance across dataset sizes from 4.8K to 650K samples
- **Consistency:** Benefits demonstrated across financial, retail, and crime analytics workloads

**Potential Business Impact:** **Preliminary modeling suggests** potential annual savings of $7,000-9,000 for similar ML workloads.

**🏆 RECOMMENDATION:** **MIGRATE TO GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM (GCP)** - Based on experimental data across 12 ML experiments, GCP emerges as the superior platform for machine learning workloads within the tested parameters.

### 1.3 Research Questions

1. **RQ1:** Which cloud platform provides superior cost efficiency for ML workloads?
2. **RQ2:** How do performance characteristics differ between AWS and GCP across dataset scales?
3. **RQ3:** What is the quantitative impact of platform-specific ML optimizations?
4. **RQ4:** How does optimal platform selection vary with workload characteristics?

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Cloud Platform Comparison Studies

Recent studies in cloud platform comparison have primarily focused on general compute workloads rather than machine learning-specific performance. **Khajeh-Hosseini et al. (2012)** established foundational methodologies for cloud cost comparison, while **Iosup et al. (2011)** developed performance benchmarking frameworks. However, these studies predate modern ML services and lack ML-specific optimization analysis.

### 2.2 Machine Learning in Cloud Computing

**Dean & Ghemawat (2008)** introduced distributed ML concepts that form the foundation of modern cloud ML services. **Chen et al. (2016)** demonstrated the importance of system optimization for ML workloads, establishing the theoretical basis for platform-specific performance differences observed in this study.

### 2.3 Cost Optimization in Cloud Computing

**Armbrust et al. (2010)** identified cost efficiency as a primary cloud computing advantage, while **Buyya et al. (2009)** developed cost optimization frameworks. Recent work by **Singh & Chana (2016)** specifically addressed ML workload cost optimization, providing context for our cost comparison methodology.

### 2.4 Research Gap

**Gap Identified:** Lack of comprehensive, quantitative comparison of AWS vs GCP specifically for machine learning workloads with statistical validation across diverse dataset characteristics.

**This Study's Contribution:** Fills this gap through rigorous experimental methodology with statistical validation across multiple ML workload types.
